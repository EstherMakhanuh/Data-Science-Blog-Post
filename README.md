## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
In this project, WHO data about cobid 19 vaccination is chosen as the dataset to be analyzed and understand the following questions:

1. What vaccination Schemes (combination of vaccines) are used in most countries and in which countries?
1. What country has the most vaccinated people?
1. What country has the highest number of people vaccinated per hundred?
1. What does the daily vaccination dynamic look like?

## File Descriptions

country_vaccinations -- this file contains each country's data about the vaccination, ie vaccinations used , number of people fulkly vaccinated,date of the data.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@makhanuhesther/covid-19-vaccination-analysis-caa60b8fdb5c).

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Udacity courses for some code ideas, and to kaggle/WHO for the data. The Licensing of data and other descriptive information can be found at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
